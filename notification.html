<p ><font size="5px" >Before You Travel</font>
<br/>
<br/>Before you travel, consider the following:
<br/>
* Is COVID-19 spreading at your destination?
<br/>
* The more cases at your destination, the more likely you are to get infected during travel and spread the virus to others when you return.
<br/>
* Check Each Stateâ€™s Cases in the Last 7 Days
<br/>
* Travel Recommendations for Destinations Around the World
<br/>
<br/>
<font size="5px">If You Travel</font><br/>
<br/>
During your trip, take steps to protect yourself and others from COVID-19:<br/>

* Wear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when in public settings.<br/>
* Avoid close contact by staying at least 6 feet apart (about 2 armsâ€™ length) from anyone who is not from your household.<br/>
* Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).<br/>
* Avoid contact with anyone who is sick.<br/>
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
<br/><br/>
<font size="5px">Tips to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19 in common travel situations:</font>
<br/><br/>
<font size="4px">In public:</font><br/><br/>
* Wear a mask in public settings.<br/>
* Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 armsâ€™ length) from anyone who is not from your household.<br/><br/>
<font size="4px">Bathrooms and rest stops:</font><br/><br/>
* Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom and after you have been in a public place.<br/>
* If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.<br/><br/>
<font size="4px">Getting gas:</font><br/><br/>
* Use disinfecting wipes on handles and buttons at the gas pumps before you touch them (if available).<br/>
* After fueling, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. When you get to your destination, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.<br/><br/>
<font size="4px">Hotels and accommodations:</font><br/><br/>
* See advice for traveling overnight.<br/><br/>
<font size="4px">Food stops:</font><br/><br/>
* The safest option is to bring your own food. If you donâ€™t bring your own food, use drive-through, delivery, take-out, and curb-side pick-up options.<br/><br/>
<font size="4px">Anticipate Your Travel Needs</font><br/><br/>
* Bring a mask to wear in public places.<br/>
* Pack hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Keep this within reach.<br/>
* Bring enough of your medicine to last you for the entire trip.<br/>
* Pack food and water in case restaurants and stores are closed, or if drive-through, take-out, and outdoor-dining options arenâ€™t available.</br>
* If you are considering cleaning your travel lodgings, see CDCâ€™s guidance on how to clean and disinfect.</br><br/>
<font size="5px">Check Travel Restrictions</font></br><br/>
State, local, and territorial governments may have travel restrictions in place, including testing requirements, stay-at-home orders, and quarantine requirements upon arrival. Follow state, local, and territorial travel restrictions. For up-to-date information and travel guidance, check the state, territorial, tribal and local health department where you are, along your route, and where you are going. Prepare to be flexible during your trip as restrictions and policies may change during your travel.</br><br/>

If traveling internationally or across international borders, check with the destinationâ€™s Office of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Health or the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information pageexternal icon for details about entry requirements and restrictions for arriving travelers, such as mandatory testing or quarantine. Local policies at your destination may require you to be tested for COVID-19 before you are allowed to enter the country. If you test positive on arrival, you may be required to isolate for a period of time. You may even be prevented from returning to the United States, as scheduled.</br><br/>

<font size="5px">After You Travel</font></br><br/>
You may have been exposed to COVID-19 on your travels. You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can be contagious without symptoms and spread the virus to others. You and your travel companions (including children) pose a risk to your family, friends, and community for 14 days after you were exposed to the virus. <br/>Regardless of where you traveled or what you did during your trip, take these actions to protect others from getting sick after you return:<br/>
<br/>
* When around others, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 armsâ€™ length) from other people who are not from your household. It is important to do this everywhere, both indoors and outdoors.<br/>
* Wear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when you are outside of your home.<br/>
* Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).<br/>
* Watch your health and look for symptoms of COVID-19. Take your temperature if you feel sick.<br/>
* Follow state, territorial, tribal and local recommendations or requirements after travel.<br/><br/>

<font size="5px">Higher Risk Activities</font><br/><br/>
* Some types of travel and activities can put you at higher risk for exposure to COVID-19 (see list below).  If you participated in higher risk activities or think that you may have been exposed before or during your trip, take extra precautions (in addition the ones listed above) to protect others for 14 days after you arrive:<br/>

* Stay home as much as possible.<br/>
* Avoid being around people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.<br/>
* Consider getting tested for COVID-19.<br/><br/>

<font size="5px">What activities are considered higher risk?</font><br/><br/>
Here are examples of activities and situations that can increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19:<br/>

Being in an area that is experiencing high levels of COVID-19, including destinations with a Level 3 Travel Health Notice. You can check the Travel Health Notices for recommendations for places you have traveled, including foreign countries and U.S. territories.  You can also check states, counties, and cities to determine if these areas are experiencing high levels of COVID-19.<br/><br/>

* Going to a large social gathering like a wedding, funeral, or party.<br/>
* Attending a mass gathering like a sporting event, concert, or parade.<br/>
* Being in crowds â€” for example, in restaurants, bars, airports, bus and train stations, or movie theaters.<br/>
* Traveling on a cruise ship or river boat.<br/><br/>

<font size="5px">For all types of transportation</font><br/><br/>
When using any type of transportation, follow these general principles:<br/><br/>

<font size="4px">Practice hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.</font>
<br/><br/>
* Before you leave, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.<br/>
* Once you reach your destination, wash your hands again with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol as soon as possible upon arrival.<br/>
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.<br/>
* Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash and wash your hands immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.<br/><br/>
<font size="5px">Practice social distancing.</font><br/><br/>

* During travel, try to keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) from people who are not in your household â€” for example, when you are waiting at a bus station or selecting seats on a train.<br/><br/>
<font size="5px">Wear Masks.</font>
<br/><br/>
* Wear a mask in public settings and when around people who donâ€™t live in your household, especially when social l distancing is difficult.<br/>
<font size="4px">Note:</font> Masks should not be placed on:<br/><br/>
* Babies and children younger than 2 years old<br/>
* Anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious<br/>
* Anyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance<br/>
* Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms.<br/><br/>
<font size="5px">Stay home when appropriate.</font><br/>
<br/>
People who are sick or have recently had a close contact (closer than 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) to a person with COVID-19 should avoid using transportation options that may put them in close contact with others (e.g., public transit, rideshare, or taxis) and should stay home except to seek medical care.<br/><br/>
If you are sick and public transportation is your only option when seeking medical care, wear a mask over your nose and mouth, practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people as much as possible), and practice hand hygiene, including using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. For non-emergency medical care, make an appointment ahead of time and, if using public transportation, travel during non-peak hours, if possible.
Have adequate supplies.<br/><br/>

Before traveling, pack sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol (in case you are unable to wash your hands at your destination). Bring your mask to wear at times when physical distancing is difficultâ€”for example, while riding on a train or bus, waiting at a rest stop, or riding in a car with people outside your household.
Protect people at risk for severe illness from COVID-19.<br/><br/>

Individuals who have an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should consider the risks and benefits of non-essential travel.<br/>
<br/>
<font size="5px">Public transit</font><br/><br/>
<font size="4px">Stay up-to-date.</font><br/><br/>

*Check with local transit authorities for the latest information on changes to services and procedures, especially if you might need additional assistance.<br/><br/>
<font size="4px">Avoid touching surfaces.</font><br/><br/>

*Limit touching frequently touched surfaces such as kiosks, digital interfaces such as touchscreens and fingerprint scanners, ticket machines, turnstiles, handrails, restroom surfaces, elevator buttons, and benches as much as possible.<br/>
*If you must touch these surfaces, as soon as you can, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water or rub your hands with sanitizer containing 60% alcohol.<br/><br/>
*Use touchless payment and no-touch trash cans and doors when available. Exchange cash or credit cards by placing them in a receipt tray or on the counter rather than by hand, if possible.<br/><br/>
<font size="5px">Practice social distancing.</font><br/><br/>

*When possible, consider traveling during non-peak hours when there are likely to be fewer people.<br/>
*Follow social distancing guidelines by staying at least 6 feet (2 meters) from people who are not from your household. For example:
Avoid gathering in groups, and stay out of crowded spaces when possible, especially at transit stations and stops.
Consider skipping a row of seats between yourself and other riders if possible.
Enter and exit buses through rear entry doors if possible.
Look for social distancing instructions or physical guides offered by transit authorities (for example, floor decals or signs indicating where to stand or sit to remain at least 6 feet apart from others).<br/><br/>
<font size="5px">Practice hand hygiene.</font><br/><br/>

*After you leave the transit station or stop, use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.<br/>
*When you arrive at your destination, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.<br/>
